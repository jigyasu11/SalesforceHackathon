LMP = Love My Phone!

Ever wondered why your phone has suddenly started draining battery? Why it has become so slow? Wondered what other people with similar device feeling right now? How their batteries are performing with respect to yours in real time? Then LMP is for you.

This app:

1. Collects battery data from your phone in real time, in non obtrusive way and send it to backend server

2. Server runs machine learning algorithms and finds out how you phone performs with respect to people with similar phones and gives your phone a rating

3. Server sends this data back to your phone where it is shown nicely in a histogram and on google maps

4.  A lower rating means your phone is draining faster as compare to other people and higher score means your phone is in good shape!

5. Show how many people in you neighborhood have similar phones on Google maps. If you do not find many then maybe time to upgrade :D
